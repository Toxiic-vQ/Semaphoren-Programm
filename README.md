<h3>English:</h3>

Hey guys, I'm an **aspiring** C-Develover, who is currently trying to wrap his head around semaphores. The output of this project should be something like 'VVssVVssVVss...', but there are still mistakes I guess.
If you have some time to spare and know about semaphores in C, please read the code and tell me what I'm doing wrong.
Please help me to become the best C-developer so I can get a job at Twitter and print out my code for Elon!
Thanks in advance.

Jungs, wieso geht der Mist hier nicht? Ich will den Output 'VVssVVssVVss...', aber anscheinend hab ich Semaphoren in C noch nicht ganz durchblickt.
