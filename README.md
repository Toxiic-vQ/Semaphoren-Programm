Hey guys, I'm an **aspiring** C-Develover :raising_hand::computer:, who is currently trying to wrap his head around semaphores. The output of this project should be something like 'VVssVVssVVss...', but there are still mistakes I guess. :broken_heart:
If you have some time to spare and know about semaphores in C, please read the code and tell me what I'm doing wrong.
Please help me to become the best C-developer so I can get a job at Twitter :bird: and print out my code for Elon! :fire::fire::fire::fire::fire:
Thanks in advance.

Jungs, wieso geht der Mist hier nicht? Ich will den Output 'VVssVVssVVss...', aber anscheinend hab ich Semaphoren in C noch nicht ganz durchblickt.
